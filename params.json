After getting to know those technologies also wanted to know about myself and help myself in helping others, so went onto teaching English in Orphanage schools and got to know that helping people is the most amazing experience. Also probably only way to thank god for giving birth as humans.\r\n\r\nCurrent phase : \r\nCurrently seeking an opportunity in London United kingdom for Agile Software Quality tester.
