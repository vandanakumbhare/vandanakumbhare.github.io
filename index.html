<p>As you can see there has been quite a gap in my professional experience. 
After Dec 2013 I went to study Automation testing in more detail and got my grasp in technologies like Selenium, Cucumber and Junits. After getting to know those technologies also wanted to know about myself and help myself in helping others, so went onto teaching English in Orphanage schools and got to know that helping people is the most amazing experience. Also probably only way to thank god for giving birth as humans.</p>
