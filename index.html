      <p>First and foremost thanks for visiting my home page.
Let me set your expectations correctly. I have provided all the information about projects I have worked on and some details about my extra curricular activities</p>

<p>Extra curricular activities -<br>
As you can see there has been quite a gap in my professional experience. 
After Dec 2013 I went to study Automation testing in more detail and got my grasp in technologies like Selenium, Cucumber and Junits. After getting to know those technologies also wanted to know about myself and help myself in helping others, so went onto teaching English in Orphanage schools and got to know that helping people is the most amazing experience. Also probably only way to thank god for giving birth as humans.</p>

<p>Current phase : 
Currently seeking an opportunity in London United kingdom for Agile Software Quality tester. Currently in India for family function but will be back in UK till November for new assignment</p>
